# âœ… Project: Healthcare Cost Prediction using Random Forest

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input Columns (Features):

- **Age** â€“ Patient's age  
- **BMI** â€“ Body Mass Index  
- **SmokingStatus** â€“ Smoker or Non-Smoker (converted to 0/1)  
- **ChronicCondition** â€“ Yes or No (converted to 0/1)  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Output Column (Target):

- **AnnualCost** â€“ Yearly healthcare expense (â‚¹)  
*(This is what we are predicting)*

---

## ðŸ¤– How the Model Predicts:

- **Model Used**: âœ… RandomForestRegressor  
- Trained with input features to learn patterns in medical cost  
- Checks how age, BMI, smoking, and chronic illness affect the cost  
- For new input data, it predicts the expected **Annual Medical Cost**

---

## ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation Results:

- âœ… **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: â‚¹206.90  
- âœ… **RÂ² Score**: 0.98 (98% accuracy)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Real Use Case:

Insurance companies can use this model to estimate a person's medical cost based on their health profile.  
It helps in setting fair premium amounts and identifying high-risk customers.
